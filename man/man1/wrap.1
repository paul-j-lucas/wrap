.SH NAME
wrap \- text reformatter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wrap
.BI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wrap
is a filter for reformatting text by wrapping and filling lines
to a given
.IR line-width ,
the default for which is 80 characters.
Lines are wrapped at
.I whitespace
characters.
A whitespace character is any character for which
.BR isspace (3)
returns non-zero
and always includes:
space (ASCII 32),
tab (9),
line-feed (10),
vertical-tab (11),
form-feed (12),
and
carriage-return (13).
.P
Non-whitespace control characters are discarded.
A control character is any character for which
.BR iscntrl (3)
returns non-zero.
.SS Whitespace Folding
Consecutive whitespace characters
are folded into a single space
with the following exceptions:
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step]. 3
Force two spaces after the end of a sentence that ends a line;
sentences are ended by an ``end-of-sentence'' character, that is, a
period, question-mark, or an exclamation-point, optionally
followed by a single-quote, double-quote, or a closing
parenthesis or bracket.  
.IP \n+[step].
Allow two spaces after the end of a sentence that does not end a line.
This distinction is made so as not to put two spaces after
a period that is an abbreviation and not the end of a sentence;
periods at the end of a line will hopefully not be abbreviations.
.IP \n+[step].
If neither the
.B \-n
nor the
.B \-N
option is specified,
two consecutive newline characters delimit a paragraph and are not folded;
more than two are folded.
If
.B \-n
is specified, newlines receive no special treatment.
If
.B \-N
is specified, every newline delimits a paragraph.
.IP \n+[step].
If the
.B \-d
option is specified,
a line beginning with a `\f(CW.\f1' (dot),
presumed to be an
.BR [nt]roff (1)
control line,
is not altered.
.SS Character Encoding
Text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8.
All multi-byte, UTF-8-encoded characters
are considered to have a width of 1.
UTF-8 Byte-Order Marks (BOMs)
are discarded.
.SH OPTIONS
An option argument
.I f
means
.IR file ,
.I n
means
.IR "unsigned integer" ,
and
.I s
means
.IR string .
.TP
.BI \-a " s"
Specifies the alias name
.I s
from the configuration file to be used.
This overrides any alias
from a matched pattern
via either the
.B \-f
or
.B \-F
options.
.TP
.BI \-b " s"
Specifies the set of ``block'' characters
.I s
that,
when the first non-whitespace character on a line,
delimits a paragraph.
.TP
.BI \-c " f"
Specifies the configuration file
.I f
to read
(default is
.BR ~/.wraprc )
if warranted.
.TP
.B \-C
Suppresses reading of any configuration file,
even one explicitly specified via
.BR \-c .
.TP
.B \-d
Does not alter lines that begin with a
.RB ` . '
(dot) presumed to be
.RB [ nt ] roff (1)
control lines.
.TP
.B \-e
Treats whitespace after an end-of-sentence character as a paragraph delimiter.
.TP
.BI \-f " f"
Reads from file
.I f
(default is standard input).
.TP
.BI \-F " f"
Sets the file-name to
.I f
as if it were being read from
but still reads from standard input.
(This allows the file-name to be matched against a pattern
in a configuration file to use an alias
while still allowing
.B wrap
to be used as part of a shell pipeline.)
.TP
.BI \-h " n"
Hang-indents
.I n
more tabs for all but the first line of each paragraph.
.TP
.BI \-H " n"
Hang-indents
.I n
more spaces for all but the first line of each paragraph
after any tabs.
.TP
.BI \-i " n"
Indents
.I n
more tabs for the first line of each paragraph.
.TP
.BI \-I " n"
Indents
.I n
more spaces for the first line of each paragraph after any tabs.
.TP
.BI \-l " s"
Specifies the line-endings to use
.IR s ,
one of
\- or \f(CWi\fP (whatever the input uses, the default),
\f(CWd\fP or \f(CWw\fP (DOS/Windows: CR+LF),
or
\f(CWu\fP (Unix: LF).
Only the first character of
.I s
is significant
and case-insensitive
(hence, for example, \f(CWdos\fP can be spelled out).
.TP
.BI \-m " n"
Mirrors tabs; equivalent to:
.BI \-t n
.BI \-q m
where
.IR "m = line-width \- tab-spaces * n" .
.TP
.BI \-M " n"
Mirrors spaces; equivalent to:
.BI \-S n
.BI \-w m
where
.IR "m = line-width \- 2n" .
.TP
.B \-n
Does not treat newlines as paragraph delimiters.
.TP
.B \-N
Treats every newline as a paragraph delimiter.
This option is useful for line-breaking code prior to printing.
.TP
.BI \-o " f"
Writes to file
.I f
(default is standard output).
.TP
.BI \-p " s"
Treats the given characters in
.I s
as paragraph delimiters.
.TP
.B \-P
Treats the leading whitespace on the first line
as a prototype for all subsequent lines.
.TP
.BI \-s " n"
Sets
.I tab-spaces
(the number of spaces a tab character should be considered the same as)
to
.I n
characters
(default is 8).
.TP
.BI \-S " n"
Prepends
.I n
leading spaces to each line after any leading tabs.
.TP
.BI \-t " n"
Prepends
.I n
leading tabs to each line.
.TP
.B \-T
Treats the first line of every paragraph as a title
and puts it on a line by itself.
.TP
.B \-v
Prints the version number to
.I stderr
and exit.
.TP
.BI \-w " n"
Sets
.I line-width
to
.I n
characters
(default is 80).
.TP
.B \-W
Treats a line beginning with whitespace as a paragraph delimiter.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PD 0
.IP 0
Success.
.IP 64
Command-line usage error.
.IP 66
Open file error.
.IP 71
System error.
.IP 73
Create file error.
.IP 74
I/O error.
.IP 78
Configuration file error.
.PD
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B HOME
The user's home directory:
used to locate the default configuration file.
If unset,
the home directory is obtained from the password database entry
for the effective user.
If that fails,
no default configuration file is read.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.wraprc
The default configuration file.
A configuration file,
even one explicitly specified via
.BR \-c ,
is neither actually checked for existence nor read
unless one of the
.BR \-a ,
.BR \-f ,
or
.B \-F
options
is specified
since it doesn't affect the result.
.SH EXAMPLE
Wrap text into paragraphs having a line width of 72 characters,
indenting one tab-stop,
and further indenting the start of each paragraph by 3 spaces:
.cS
wrap -m1 -I3
.cE 0
