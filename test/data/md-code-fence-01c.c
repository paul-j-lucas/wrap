/*
 * C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.
 *
 * ~~~
 * #include <stdio.h>
 *
 * int main( void ) {
 *   printf( "hello, world\n" );
 * }
 * ~~~
 *
 * By design,
 * C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions,
 * and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language,
 * including operating systems,
 * as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.
