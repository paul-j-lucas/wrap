 * C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting
 * structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static
 * type system prevents many unintended operations.  By design, C provides
 * constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and
 * therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been
 * coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various
 * application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded
 * systems.
