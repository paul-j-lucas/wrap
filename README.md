wrap
====

**wrap** is a filter for reformatting text
by wrapping and filling lines
to a given line-width.
It is like **fmt**(1)
but has many more options
including, but not limited to, those for
indenting (with either tabs, spaces, or both),
hang indenting (with either tabs, spaces, or both),
mirroring (equal left and right margins),
when to delimit paragraphs,
and
title lines.

It also includes **wrapc**
that is useful for reformatting comments
in source code.

To install:

```sh
  $ autoreconf -fiv
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install
  $ man wrap
```
